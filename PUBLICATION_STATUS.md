# Publication status

## Current state

The five-model primary experiment and preregistered analysis are complete. The
primary decision is `failed_to_reproduce`; measured values and interpretation
limits are in `RESULTS.md`, with auditable artifacts in `artifacts/primary`.

The repository now includes a versioned technical report of the completed
primary experiment under `paper/`. It is not a completed archival or
peer-reviewed paper. The historical PDF is not evidence for the new study and
the removed self-audit manuscript must not be restored as the contribution.

## Release gate

A paper or archival release requires all of the following:

1. **Complete:** greedy runs for all five primary checkpoints and all 164 tasks.
2. **Complete:** functional evaluation with pinned EvalPlus 0.3.1 inside a
   disposable, network-isolated container.
3. **Complete for the primary run:** model revisions, environment metadata,
   raw/sanitized completions, evaluator outputs, and checksums are checked in.
4. **Complete:** the preregistered rank endpoint, paired uncertainty, and
   three-way decision were generated from task-level artifacts.
5. **Open:** run the planned 20-sample sensitivity condition and any conditions
   it triggers under `EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md`.
6. **Open:** obtain a second-person review of protocol-to-artifact mapping and
   the eventual manuscript.
7. **Open:** deposit immutable release artifacts at a persistent public
   identifier.

## Additional control status

A full 164-task StarCoder2-3B generation through unmodified EvalPlus 0.3.1 is
retained in `artifacts/controls/`. Static comparison finds two sanitized records
that differ from the primary generation. Functional scoring is intentionally
pending: Docker or an equivalent hardened container runtime is not installed on
this workstation, and model-generated Python will not be executed on the host.

The two-task unmodified-EvalPlus equivalence check is complete for all five
models. Raw and sanitized records match the retained primary artifacts byte for
byte; hashes and condition metadata are in
`protocol/all_models_stock_equivalence.json`.

Until the open gates pass, the defensible claim is limited to the completed
primary condition and its stated interpretation boundary; do not describe the
repository as a finished or peer-reviewed paper.
